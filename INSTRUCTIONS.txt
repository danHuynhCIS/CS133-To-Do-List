To run the project, make sure to change the working directory in the terminal to the 'src' folder. 
The program should already be built, but just in case, here's the command to compile all the necessary files.

g++ -std=c++11 Task.cpp TaskManager.cpp TaskNode.cpp ToDoMain.cpp FileManager.cpp -o main.exe

Then, you can run the program by typing the command ./main.exe

Once the program is running, everything else is pretty self-explanatory. 
You can test the file processing by loading a to-do list from the provided example.txt, perform any desired manipulations, then choose Save As to save the list as a .txt.
